![2024 written with balloon letters against a backdrop of fireworks and confetti, with the title 'Using Godot with C# in 2024'.](2024-01-01-godot-csharp-2024/header.jpg)

About a year and a half ago, starting a project with Godot and C# was a brave choice. There's always been a C# channel in the main Godot Discord server, but information and tutorials (let alone demos) were all but non-existent.

Now that it's 2024, let's take a look and see how far we've come.

<!-- truncate -->

## ü•≥ A LOT has happened

Throughout 2023, a lot of things happened in the game development world. Some of these changes were big news for game developers using C#, too:

- [Godot 4][godot4] was released!
- [Unity did things][can-godot-deliver] that game developers didn't like.
- Godot's [C# integration was completely overhauled][mono-to-net] and ported over from Mono to the .NET SDK.
- [Experimental iOS and Android mobile platform support for C# Godot games][csharp-mobile] shipped in Godot 4.2.
- The [Godot Forums][godot-forums] came back in style.
- W4 Games, the company created by some of the Godot founders, [raised another $15 million][w4].
- The Godot Fund is now bringing in [over $60,000/month][godot-fund]!

Besides Godot's increased financial support and broader endorsements from established organizations, the Godot C# community itself continues to thrive. We've even observed a new baseline level of user activity on the Chickensoft website, beginning right about the time that Unity was introducing an installation fee.

## üéÆ A Complete Game Demo

Late in 2023, we released an open source, fully-tested 3D platformer game demo built with Godot and C# using the awesome [GDQuest] assets. We'll be maintaining the demo over the next year, too, keeping it up-to-date and cleaning it up as we learn new things.

[Chickensoft GameDemo on GitHub](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/GameDemo)

[Gamefromscratch] covered our game demo, too ‚Äî check it out below!

[Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQyEu1pkcTk)

If you want to know more about it, feel free to read our recent [treatise on game architecture][game-arch] ‚Äî it breaks the demo down and goes into painstaking detail about the technical decisions that went into it. But, bring your reading glasses ‚Äî it's a _long_ read.

Speaking of Godot game architecture with C#, there's now also the [Godot Architecture Organization Advice][godot-arch-advice] repository ‚Äî go check it out and give it a star, too!

## üõ† The Power to Make Games

Chickensoft is now home to 14 open source packages designed to solve common problems you might run into if you're using Godot with C#:

- [GodotEnv]: Automate and standardize Godot installation, version switching, and addon management on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- [GoDotTest]: Run and debug automated tests locally or from the command-line for CI/CD purposes.
- [setup-godot]: Install and run Godot on macOS, Linux, and Windows GitHub runners with support for Godot export templates.
- [LogicBlocks]: Easy-to-use, hierarchical state machines for games. It even generate state diagrams of your code for you, too.
- [AutoInject]: Tree-based dependency injection that lets you easily scope dependencies to specific Godot scene subtrees.
- [GodotGame]: Template for quickly spinning up a C# game with the Chickensoft best practices already applied.
- ...and more, all easily reachable from our [homepage][chickensoft].

## üèÜ Fun Highlights from 2023

### üé® TerraBrush

[TerraBrush] is a Godot map editor addon written in C# by [spimort], and it features a number of incredible map-editing capabilities. Be sure to give it a star and try it out in your next 3D project!

![The TerraBrush map editor being used inside the Godot game engine.](https://github.com/spimort/TerraBrush/raw/main/preview.gif?raw=true)
[TerraBrush](https://github.com/spimort/TerraBrush) is a recently released map editor addon for Godot built in C#.

### üç∞ Layer Generator

[Anton] released [GodotLayersSourceGenerator], a generator that will produce mappings of your collision layer names. He also updated [BinaryBundle], a C# serialization generator for use with netcode.

:::tip
If you are looking for more C# generators, take a look at the [GodotSharp.SourceGenerators] project: it has generators for the scene tree, input mappings, and a ton of other stuff.

### üì∫ Arbitrary Color Reduction and Palette Ordered Dithering

If you're looking to make your game a little more retro, check out Mark's [Arbitrary Color Reduction and Palette Ordered Dithering][dither] shader that was released recently. Here's a video of it applied to a pseudo-isometric 3D scene:

### üåâ Unidot Importer

Looking to bring assets over from Unity? You can now do that easily with the [Unidot Importer][unidot] ‚Äî it will automatically convert your `.unitypackage` assets into Godot `.tscn` scene files!

## üê§ An Open Source Community

If you're using Godot with C#, or interested in doing so, you are no longer alone! Many of us are actively working on creating a better game development future with Godot and C# by sharing tools, documentation, and games we create. We'd love to see you, too!

:::note
Chickensoft is a grassroots community and open source organization dedicated to furthering the use of Godot with C#. We're excited to have a community of over a 1,000 members now, and folks have graciously contributed a number of bugfixes and features to our open source packages over the last year. Come say hi!

## The State of Game Development with C# and Godot in 2024

![A screenshot of our multiplayer demonstration](2024-01-01-godot-csharp-2024/header.jpg)

Here are all the things we're looking forward to in 2024, and why we're more excited than ever to build games using C# and Godot.

## What's New?

The biggest news is the 1.0 release of our [Game Template][game-template]! It's a complete, MIT-licensed sample game that demonstrates all of the features we'd expect in a modern game made with Godot and C#.

[Chickensoft GameDemo on GitHub](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/GameDemo)

Check out this video of our sample game in action:

Thanks for reading! Here's to an amazing 2024 full of games made with Godot and C#!
